# snap collector plugin - ethtool

This plugin uses ethtool to gather interface statistics. 																						Current version exposes stats available using `ethtool -S` and `ethtool -d` command.

It's used in the [snap framework](http://github.com:intelsdi-x/snap).

## Getting Started

The plugin is ready to use out of the box. You don't have to perform any configuration or installation steps.

### System Requirements

* ethtool available under `$PATH` or `/sbin/`
* [golang 1.4+](https://golang.org/dl/)

### Operating systems
All OSs currently supported by plugin:
* Linux/amd64

### Installation
#### Download ethtool plugin binary:
You can get the pre-built binaries for your OS and architecture at snap's [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/intelsdi-x/snap/releases) page.

#### To build the plugin binary:
Fork https://github.com/intelsdi-x/snap-plugin-collector-ethtool  
Clone repo into `$GOPATH/src/github.com/intelsdi-x/`:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/<yourGithubID>/snap-plugin-collector-ethtool.git
```

Build the plugin by running make within the cloned repo:
```
$ make
```
This builds the plugin in `/build/rootfs/`

### Configuration and Usage
* Set up the [snap framework](https://github.com/intelsdi-x/snap/blob/master/README.md#getting-started)
* Ensure `$SNAP_PATH` is exported  
`export SNAP_PATH=$GOPATH/src/github.com/intelsdi-x/snap/build`

####Tips:
-Adding more metrics to monitor per NIC is very cheap in terms of CPU time.


## Documentation

You can learn about some of exposed metrics [here](https://www.myricom.com/software/myri10ge/397-could-you-explain-the-meanings-of-the-myri10ge-counters-reported-in-the-output-of-ethtool.html)

### Collected Metrics
This plugin allows to collect interface network statistics such like received|transmitted bytes|packets and more.                                                                                                    
List of metrics for each device is dependent on it's driver.

This plugin has the ability to gather the following metrics (driver specific):
* [for driver E1000E](MTS_E1000E.md)
* [for driver IXGBE](MTS_IXGBE.md)
* [for driver FM10K](MTS_FM10K.md)
* [for driver TG3](MTS_TG3.md)

Metrics are available in namespace: 
*	`/intel/net/<driver name>/<device name>/nic/<metric name>` (from cmd `ethtool -S`)
*	`/intel/net/<driver name>/<device name>/reg/<metric name>` (from cmd `ethtool -d`, register dump)

By default metrics are gathered once per second.

### Roadmap
As we launch this plugin, we have a few items in mind for the next release:

- [ x ] Metrics from device's registry dump when using IXGBE driver
- [   ] Expose pluggable optics (SFP & QSFP) information

If you have a feature request, please add it as an [issue](https://github.com/intelsdi-x/snap-plugin-collector-ethtool/issues).
