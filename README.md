## Getting Started

The plugin is ready to use out of the box. You don't have to perform any configuration or installation steps.

### System Requirements

* ethtool available under `$PATH` or `/sbin/`
* [golang 1.4+](https://golang.org/dl/)

### Operating systems
All OSs currently supported by plugin:
* Linux/amd64

### Installation
#### Download ethtool plugin binary:
You can get the pre-built binaries for your OS and architecture at snap's [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/intelsdi-x/snap/releases) page.

#### To build the plugin binary:
Fork https://github.com/intelsdi-x/snap-plugin-collector-ethtool  
Clone repo into `$GOPATH/src/github.com/intelsdi-x/`:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/<yourGithubID>/snap-plugin-collector-psutil.git
```

Build the plugin by running make within the cloned repo:
```
$ make
```
This builds the plugin in `/build/rootfs/`

### Configuration and Usage
* Set up the [snap framework](https://github.com/intelsdi-x/snap/blob/master/README.md#getting-started)
* Ensure `$SNAP_PATH` is exported  
`export SNAP_PATH=$GOPATH/src/github.com/intelsdi-x/snap/build`

####Tips:
-Adding more metrics to monitor per NIC is very cheap in terms of CPU time.


## Documentation

You can learn about some of exposed metrics [here](https://www.myricom.com/software/myri10ge/397-could-you-explain-the-meanings-of-the-myri10ge-counters-reported-in-the-output-of-ethtool.html)

### Collected Metrics
List of metrics for each device is dependent on it's driver.
Metrics are available in namespace `/intel/net/<device name>/<metric name>` and all are `int`'s.

### Roadmap
As we launch this plugin, we have a few items in mind for the next release:

* Metrics from device's registry dump when using IXGBE driver.
